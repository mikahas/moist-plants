# Moist plants

Create a soil hygrometer using an Arduino and check the moisture levels of your plant!

This small project lights up 1-9 LEDs depending to the soil moisture level.

## Requirements

### Arduino

For this project I used an Arduino nano but most Arduino boards will suffice.
Only requirements are 5 volts for the moisture sensor, 9 output pins for the LEDs.
One analog input pin is needed to read the data from the sensor. The Arduino should be powered with a normal
USB charger and that should be enough for the sensor as well.

### Components

- Moisture sensor, mine has "Moisture Sensor Meroduino" printed on it
- 5 LEDs, I chose blue, green and red
- 5 resistors (e.g. 220 ohm) for the LEDs
- Wires and a breadboard
